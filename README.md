Library Management & Book Tracking System — Client Problem Statement
Client Information

Client Name: Henry Moreno
Position: Operations Manager
Organization: EduLib Schools Consortium
Type: Private School Network (14 schools)

📌 Background

EduLib Schools Consortium currently manages library records using Excel sheets and handwritten logbooks. This has resulted in missing books, inconsistent records, and difficulties tracking which school holds which materials.

The organization wants to transition to a centralized digital library system that is easy for librarians—many of whom have limited ICT skills—to use effectively.

🔥 Current Problems

All library records (books, borrowers, returns) are stored in paper files or Excel, causing frequent data loss and errors.

Books are often lost or unreturned, with no automated overdue tracking.

New book entries are typed manually, resulting in wrong titles, authors, and genres.

Administrators cannot easily generate reports such as:

Most borrowed books

Books per school

Overdue books

No standardized system across the 14 school libraries.

🎯 Project Goal

To build a simple, reliable Library Management & Book Tracking System that improves accountability, reduces book loss, and standardizes library operations across all EduLib schools.
